       <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
       <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
       <li><span class="list1"> <strong>Css is not necessary</strong> </span> <span class="list2"> <strong> CSS saves a lot of work.</strong></span>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>

<h2 class="heading2">CSS can be added in HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
   <ul type="disc" class="list4">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file. </li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="list5"> <strong> in this
            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</strong></span>  because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier
            for you to try it yourself.</li>

    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
    special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the 
    element.
</p>
<p>
    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
